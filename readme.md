### Simple Todo API
This is a simple Todo API built with Node.js and Express. It allows you to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of todos stored in a JSON file.

## Setup
Clone the repository:

## bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-todo-api.git
Install dependencies:
Navigate into the project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The server will start running on port 3000 by default.

API Endpoints
GET /todos
Retrieves all todos from the JSON file.

POST /todos
Creates a new todo with the provided title and description. A unique random id is generated for each todo.

DELETE /todos/:id
Deletes the todo with the specified id.

Usage
You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

Example Usage:
GET /todos

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/todos
POST /todos

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Example Todo", "description":"This is an example todo."}' http://localhost:3000/todos
DELETE /todos/:id
Replace :id with the id of the todo you want to delete. For example:

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/todos/12345
Notes
Todos are stored in a JSON file named todos.json.
Each todo has a unique random id generated when created.
Error handling is minimal in this example for brevity. In a production environment, you should implement more robust error handling and validation.
Feel free to customize and extend this API according to your needs!
